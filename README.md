Search and find recipes from all over the world using [spoonacular api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
This is a small tool for culinary enthusiast, making it easy to search and find new and exciting recipes.
In the future it is planned to be added authentication and authorization + ability for each user to add recipes in his presonal favourites lists.

The application is build with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), using [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) for state management and bundled with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). For user authentication/authorization and the ability to create/update/delete lists where users can store favourite recipes it is used [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) headless CMS.
